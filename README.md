# Angular2 Practice
It's not innovative. It's not useful. It's not beautiful. It's just a random project to learn and practice Angular2.

## Software factory
* Gulp (because I already know it) + Browserify

### TODO
Try :
* npm scripts
* Webpack


## Search pages

### Used features
* HTTP request with promise (`HttpModule`)
* Router (`RouterModule`)
* Resolve (`Resolve` & `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` interfaces)
* Custom pipe (`Pipe` decorator & `PipeTransform` interface)
* App configuration (normal class)

### TODO
* Try observable instead of promise
* Use relative paths for templateUrl
* Reorganize files into folders (components, services, pipes...?)
* Create a navigation menu to access different pages
* Make it ~~beautiful~~ less ugly (Bootstrap ?)

## Login pages
### TODO (everything)
* Learn Firebase and AngularFire ?
* Auth0 ?
